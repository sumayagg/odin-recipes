# 🍰 My First Recipe Website: Odin Recipes 🥕🥧

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my **super simple** recipe website project. This is my first time coding a webpage, and I'm really excited to share some delicious recipes with you! 😄

## What is This?
This project is a part of **The Odin Project** where I'm learning web development.

## What's Inside? 🤔
This website is basically a collection of a few awesome recipes like:
- **Carrot Cake** 🥕🍰 (My personal favorite!)
- **Gorditas** 🥙 (Yummy Mexican food)
- **Pecan Pie** 🥧 (Because dessert is life)

## How It Works:
1. **HTML only!** No fancy CSS or JavaScript here—just plain, simple HTML.
2. There are recipe pages for each dish with easy-to-follow steps.
3. Pictures included, because who doesn’t love food pics? 😋

## Things I Plan to Do Next:
- Add some **CSS** to make it look a little prettier.
- Maybe throw in some **JavaScript** for fun interactions later.

Thanks for stopping by, and wish me luck on my coding journey! 🚀
